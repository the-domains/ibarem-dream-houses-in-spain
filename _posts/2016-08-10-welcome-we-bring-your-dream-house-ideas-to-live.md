## Architecture with senses

IBAREM have though out many years created our own sense and feel for the new modern Mediterranean essence within the architecture, but the backbone is still the Danish origin which means that we design from inside and out, setting the conform and "hygge" in the centre.

Bringing new elements into the Mediterranean traditional building form with all respect and bringing back old long time elements as patios, porches, shadows and interior patios back into the new modern vanguard style, a new interpretation made by us plus a focus on construction details and way to do things back home in Denmark. Provide a degree of comfort to our well-defined and modern architecture.

## From dream to the first sketch

Right from the first contact you will experience working with IBAREM as something special and we hope to inspire trust, inside and understanding.

Our initial effort is free, we don't charge for the first step and dialog. We want your house as much as you and your family. We will pursue your dream and give you the needed feedback to get the perfect result - and as much house for the money.

Only when we are sure that the dream is based on a solid foundation, by common understanding, then the architect team starts to draw the lines that will be forming the frames of your new future home.
